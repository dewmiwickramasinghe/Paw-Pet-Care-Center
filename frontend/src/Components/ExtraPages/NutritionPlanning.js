      <h1>Nutrition Planning for Your Pet</h1>
      <p>
        At Paw Pet Care, we understand that a balanced diet is key to your pet’s health.
        Our nutrition planning services are tailored to meet the specific needs of your pet
        based on their breed, age, weight, and health conditions. We take a comprehensive approach to
        create customized meal plans to ensure your pet maintains a healthy weight and gets the proper
        nutrients they need.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Nutrition Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Proper nutrition is essential for your pet’s health and well-being. Just like humans, pets require
        the right balance of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to stay healthy. Poor nutrition can lead
        to a variety of health problems, such as obesity, allergies, digestive issues, and more. By
        providing your pet with a personalized nutrition plan, you can help them avoid these issues and
        live a longer, healthier life.
      </p>

        <li>
          <strong>Portion Control Guidelines:</strong> Proper portion sizes are crucial for weight management. 
          We help you understand how much to feed your pet to avoid overeating or underfeeding, both of which can lead
          to health issues.

          <strong>Allergen-Free Diets:</strong> If your pet has food allergies, we create allergen-free meal plans

          that may be causing sensitivities.

        <li>
          <strong>Weight Management Plans:</strong> Whether your pet is overweight or underweight, we offer

          calorie-controlled meals and healthy snack alternatives.
